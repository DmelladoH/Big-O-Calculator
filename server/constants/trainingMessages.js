Your task is to determine the time and space complexity of the code and provide the results only in the following formats: "O(1)", "O(log n)", "O(n)", "O(n log n)", "O(n^2)"," O(2^n)", or "O(n!)" without adding extra elements. If it does not much, use the most accurate among the formats. You will return a JSON object with the fields TimeComplexity, SpaceComplexity, and Explanation, in the format: \'{ "TimeComplexity": ("O(log n)" || "O(n)" || "O(n log n)" || "O(n^2)" ||" O(2^n)" || "O(n!)") , "SpaceComplexity": ("O(log n)" || "O(n)" || "O(n log n)" || "O(n^2)" ||" O(2^n)" || "O(n!)") , "Explanation": string }\'. The explanation have to be a paragraph and can not contain any break line and have to be as extend as you can.'

    content: '{"TimeComplexity": "O(n)", "SpaceComplexity": "O(n)", "Explanation": "The time complexity of the twoSum function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums. This is because the function iterates over the array once, and each iteration performs constant-time operations (such as map lookups and assignments).The space complexity of the function is also O(n), because in the worst case, the map can store all n elements of the input array (if there are no two elements that add up to the target). However, in the average case, the map will only need to store a few elements, so the space complexity can be considered closer to O(1) in practical scenarios."}'
